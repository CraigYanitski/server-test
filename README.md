# server-test

This is my work on the server project from [boot.dev](https://boot.dev). 
It is demonstrates the backend of a Twitter (sorry for dead-naming) clone using a PostgreSQL database. 
It also includes features such as authentication, but can be developed a bit further to be functional/useful.
